            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
              UniRide started with a simple observation on a campus road: dozens
              of cars arriving each morning from the same three suburbs, most of
              them carrying one person. Students were spending a large part of
              their monthly budget on travel while seats sat empty next to them.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
              The platform connects those journeys. It verifies who is driving,
              splits the real cost of the trip between the people in the car,
              and keeps the route visible to passengers and the people waiting
              for them.
